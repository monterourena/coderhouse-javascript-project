## Project
The content of this repository shows a basic code generated in Javascript for the calculation of compound interest. This project corresponds to the first submission for the Javascript course Coderhouse, commission 51330.

## Description

Compound interest is a financial phenomenon in which interest generated in one period of time is added to the original principal, and in the next period interest is generated again on the total principal. 

This means that the interest generated accumulates over time, making the growth of the principal exponential 
rather than linear. 

The importance of compound interest lies in the fact that it allows for significant capital growth over the long term, as long as a constant interest rate is maintained. It can be calculated using the formula: C = P * (1 + r)^t, where C is the total capital after t periods, P is the initial capital, r is the interest rate and t is the number of periods.
